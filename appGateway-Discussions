Messages should have short TTL in the queue. Old messages like status have are
not of any value. Only the latest is of interest.

How to:
    Read and Process messages
        - One goroutine per message type/queue
        - For goroutine:
            - should handle it's own panic so as to affect others
            - read message
            - process
            - go back to reading queue
        -For HeartBeat/Health goroutine:
            - analyse and verify message
            - update service cache
            - log status in a time series DB
        - For Service Discovery :
            - analyse and verify message
            - check cache and get the next available service info
            - return service discovery info
        - For Config update
            - analyse and verify message
            - create a new config cache 
            - swap cache pointer

    Cache Management:
        - should all accesses be sync.Locked ?
        - create a cache data structure
        - what is the key to finding items in cache ?
